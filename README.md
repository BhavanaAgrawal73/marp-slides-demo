* Question 2
As a technical writer at a software company, you need to create a product documentation presentation using Marp. The documentation should be maintainable in version control and easily convertible to different formats.

Create a Marp Markdown presentation that includes:

Your email (21f2000670@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) in the presentation
A custom theme specification
Page numbers
At least one slide with a background image
Custom styling using Marp directives
Mathematical equations (e.g., for algorithmic complexity)
